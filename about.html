            Hi! My name is <b>John Emmanuel Topacio</b>,
            I study at <b>St. Dominic College of Asia</b>. I like learning new things and improving my skills. 
            One of my favorite hobbies is coding because I enjoy making projects and fixing problems in 
            programs. I also love playing badminton because it keeps me active and helps me improve. 
            In my free time, I play online games to relax and have fun with my friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to gain more knowledge and skills in my field to be well-prepared for my future career. 
            My goal is to find a job where I can apply what I have learned and continue growing. I am also interested in 
            gaining experience through internships or projects that will help me improve.
        </p>
