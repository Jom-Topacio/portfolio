                Hi! My name is <b>John Emmanuel Topacio</b>, and I am <b>19 years old.</b>
                I study at <b>St. Dominic College of Asia</b>. I like learning new things and improving my skills. 
                One of my favorite hobbies is coding because I enjoy making projects and fixing problems in 
                programs. I also love playing badminton because it keeps me active and helps me improve. 
                In my free time, I play online games to relax and have fun with my friends.
                 </p>
                <p>
                I want to gain more knowledge and skills in my field to be well-prepared for my future career. 
                My goal is to find a job where I can apply what I have learned and continue growing. I am also interested in 
                gaining experience through internships or projects that will help me improve.
                </p>
